 # Why is Swift relevant to a Functional Programming meetup?
 
 Well, Swift has:
 
 - immutable data structures
 - first-class / higher-order functions
 - product and sum types
 - type safety (and strong typing)
 - both lazy and eager (by default) evaluation
 - powerful pattern matching
 - and much more!
